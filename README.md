# Risk profiling for customer churn

In this project I downloaded a customer churn dataset from Kaggle, applied some data transformation, and used a linear regression model to calculate the churn risk of customers.

The work was published in a medium article: https://katinka-gereb.medium.com/risk-profiling-for-customer-churn-analysis-f5ec928f512e

## Data

The dataset is from: https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling

The dataset will have to be downloaded in the `kaggle_datasets/Churn_Modelling.csv` folder. 

## Requirements

A Python 3.7.4 virtual environment was created for this project. The corresponding packages can be found in the requirements.txt file.

pip install requirements.text

## Final result

The following pie chart represents the churn risk distribution amongst employees.
