# Risk profiling for customer churn

In this project I downloaded a customer churn dataset using the Kaggle API, applied some data transformation, and used a linear regression model to calculate the churn risk of customers.

## Python environment
A Python 3.8.0 virtual environment was created for this project. The corresponding packages can be found in the requirements.txt file.
